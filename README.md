# HAW CTF 2018

```This repository moved to a private repository inside of the HAW Hamburg network```

The assignment, is to create 4 simple IT Security CTF (Capture the Flag) Challenges, for other teams to resolve.

We have created 2 Binary challenges, which utilise exotic kinds of Buffer Overflows.

And 2 Web Challenges, which utilise XXE vulnerabilities and blind SQL Injection.
